Description: secure production identity framework for everyone in Go (library)
 SPIFFE, the Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone, is a
 set of open-source standards for securely identifying software
 systems in dynamic and heterogeneous environments. Systems that adopt
 SPIFFE can easily and reliably mutually authenticate wherever they
 are running.
 .
 This library leverages the SPIFFE Workload API
 (https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE_Workload_API.md),
 providing high level functionality that includes:
 .
  * Establishing mutually authenticated TLS (mTLS) between workloads
    powered by SPIFFE.
  * Obtaining and validating X509-SVIDs and JWT-SVIDs.
  * Federating trust between trust domains using SPIFFE bundles.
  * Bundle management.
 .
 See the Go Package (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spiffe/go-spiffe/v2)
 documentation for more information.
 .
 This package contains the library.
